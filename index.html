      <h3>Hi, MY NAME IS ANUSH</h3>
      <p>I am passionate about coding, finance, investing, golf and football. I am currently a business student at ESSEC Business School as well as a part time finance intern at PulseiD.</p>
      <p>During my free time, I take pleasure in researching companies and analysing their valuations on the market. I likewise offer tips and guidance on certain areas, for example, investing and financial markets, to my family, friends and colleagues on different platforms such as email, group chats and web-based media. As Ernest Hemingway said, "If something is wrong, fix it now. But train yourself not to worry, worry fixes nothing". This quote is particularly essential to me since I for one believe that the ability to work effectively under pressure is indispensable in a financial career. I have acquired this quality after spending 24 months in the gruelling SAF (Singapore Armed Forces) 3rd Battalion Singapore Guards
	
	  Working as a junior system engineer in a company called OpenSource, I understood consumer needs and developed new systems to address them. In the context of technical systems, I participated in the installation and management of new systems. I ran tests on their effectiveness, produced reports about their efficacy, and rendered changes accordingly. I also maintained the security of these systems and their data. Moreover, I served as liaison between the engineering team and other teams to determine what changes need to be made. This internship hardened my skills in systems engineering, information security, and data integration. In addition, my communication and conflict resolution skills were enhanced as well.
